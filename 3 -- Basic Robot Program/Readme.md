1. Pre-Requisites
    1. Internet connection
    1. Git

1. Clone the basic robot repository from GitHub

1. Open the project in IntelliJ
    1. Click the "Open" button in IntelliJ. Navigate to the folder that you cloned in the previous step. The folder should have a green Gradle icon. Click on the **folder** (not a file).
