# Programming Lesson 01 - Introduction

Welcome to the Team 5190 training lessons in programming a FRC robot. These lessons are intended to help the FRC programmers get started, understand the basics, and be prepared for developing more advanced software techniques in robotics.

In these lessons, we use:

* [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org) as the programming language. Kotlin is a modern developer language that is based on the Java Virtual Machine.

* [IntelliJ IDEA](http://jetbrains.com) as the development environment.

* Most of the lessons require you to develop, deploy, and test your code on a real FRC robot. The requirements of such a robot are [here](TODO). Team 5190's Falcon Mini robot is a robot that we have specifically built to help with this training.

These lessons do not help you with:

* Teaching the basics of programming. If you are new to programming, follow the lesson plan and tutorials here first. You are expected to understand basic elements of programming in Java - classes, objects, inheritance, loops, and conditions.

* Teaching the Kotlin programming language. You can find enough tutorials on this subject online, and you are expected to become proficient in the language in parallel.

* Building the robot. We will aim to create similar lessons on the mechanical and electrical elements of robot construction in a subsequent series.

Here is an outline of the lessons that we have planned so far:

1. **Introduction** covers the essentials needed to set up your development machine.

1. **Hello world** is your first program that you deploy to the robot. It will run on the robot and print a Hello world" message for you in the FRC dashboard.

1. **Driving a Talon** will help you program a Talon SRX controller. You will program the robot for manual and autonomous driving in this lesson.

1. **Closed-loop control using encoders** will teach you to integrate an encoder to drive a fixed distance.

1. **Path tracking** is an core element of many robots and involves making the robot track a pre-defined path. You will learn the basic elements of path tracking and the complexity of doing this well.

1. **Object recognition** sets up a simple vision pipeline integrated with your robot to recognize objects of a certain color.

Let us get you started now with the prerequisites. Follow the steps below.

1. You need a Windows 10 laptop wth 4GB or more memory and 50GB or more of free disk space.

1. Install the JDK from this site.

1. Set up the JAVA_HOME system environment variable.

1. Install the IntelliJ IDEA from this site.

1. Follow the tutorial here to create your first Kotlin program. We want to make sure your Kotlin development environment is fully set up.

1. Install the FRC dashboard application from this site. This is the dashboard for interacting with and driving your robot.

1. If you are not familiar with programming in Java or Kotlin, this is a good time for you to follow the tutorials here to try a few more exercises.
