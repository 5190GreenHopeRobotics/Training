## Java programming

If you are not proficient with Java, you must go through this lesson path. This self-guided learning path helps you learn Java at your own pace, and helps you have more time building robot during build time. Completing these topics will enable you to know core Java syntax, understand usage of built-in data types, and help you implement new ones. It will provide the foundation to help you take additional advanced Java modules and to perform introductory robotic programming.

## FRC programming

If you have reached a certain level of proficiency with Java (e.g., lesson 10 in the Java programming learning path), you can get started with the FRC programming learning path. This is mainly a mentor/veteran student led training; it will start with the basics of robotics programming, and will go into more advanced topics such as vision and path tracking as we progress.
